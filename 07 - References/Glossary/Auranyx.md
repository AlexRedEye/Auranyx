**Pronunciation:** _awr-uh-nicks_ (OR-uh-niks)
**(noun)**  
The name of the world and the broader ecosystem in which mana originated and evolved.  
Auranyx is a biologically and magically reactive planet whose deep-core processes generate Aurox (mana). Its geography, ecosystems, and civilizations are shaped by long-term mana cycles, ley-line flows, vent networks, and historic bloom events.  
In academic contexts, “Auranyx” may refer specifically to the planet’s mana-ecology as a unified system.

**Usage:**  
“Mana storms are common in the northern quadrant—Auranyx breathes heavily there.”
