**Pronunciation:** _awr-EE-nee-uh_ (or EE-nee-uh)  
**Singular:** **Auryne** — _awr-EEN_ (or EEN)  
**Slang:** **Flux Lungs**  
**Scientific Term:** Auronex / Auronexi

**(noun; plural)**  
Biological organs that allow living beings to absorb, filter, and regulate Aurox. Often compared to lungs, Aurynea enable breath-based magic by converting ambient mana into controlled internal energy. Their capacity is influenced by genetics, stress exposure, environmental mana levels, and training.  
Overuse or overload can cause mutation, degradation, or catastrophic failure. Strivers colloquially refer to them as **“Flux Lungs.”**

**Usage:**  
“His Aurynea are overstrained—get him out of the storm zone now.”
