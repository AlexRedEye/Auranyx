# Auranyx - World Bible

A comprehensive worldbuilding project for **Auranyx**, a fantasy world where magic is a natural biological phenomenon powered by planetary energy.

## 📖 About Auranyx

Auranyx is a biologically and magically reactive planet where mana—known scientifically as **Aurox**—originates from deep within the planet's core. This ambient energy field flows through vents, ley lines, and atmospheric currents, shaping ecosystems, civilizations, and the very biology of its inhabitants.

Living beings have evolved specialized organs called **Aurynea** (colloquially "Flux Lungs") that absorb and regulate mana through breath, enabling them to perform magic. However, this power comes at a cost: overuse leads to physical stress, mutation, and potentially catastrophic consequences.

## 🔮 Key Concepts

- **Mana System**: A hard magic system with strict natural laws and biological constraints
- **Aurox**: The scientific term for measurable ambient mana
- **Aurynea**: Biological "mana organs" that enable magic use
- **Strivers**: Pioneers who use forced adaptation to push magical boundaries
- **Reactor Technology**: Artificial mana systems that democratize magic beyond biological casters
