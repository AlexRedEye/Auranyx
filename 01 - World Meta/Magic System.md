## Core Concept
Mana is a natural planetary energy field called Aurox, released into the world during the First Mana Bloom and now flowing through vents, ley lines, and atmospheric currents. Living beings gradually adapted to it, developing specialized organs called Aurynea—“Flux Lungs” in Striver slang—that absorb and regulate ambient mana through breath. Magic is the biological manipulation and transformation of this energy, constrained by natural laws and shaped by environment, mutation, and personal discipline. Though unified in source, mana use varies widely among casters, and its imbalance can reshape bodies, ecosystems, and entire civilizations.

## Source of Mana
**Mana (Aurox) originates from deep within Auranyx’s core, produced through a fusion-like pressure process that releases energy upward through planetary vents.**  
This energy enters the world via **mana vents**, spreads along **ley lines**, and rises into the atmosphere where it forms ambient currents and pressure zones.

Mana is **finite per region but naturally self-replenishing**, restoring itself through continuous deep-core generation unless overdrawn.  
Environmental factors such as **mana storms**, **celestial alignments**, **tectonic ruptures**, and **ley-line intersections** dramatically alter local density, creating zones of abundance, drought, or violent instability.

# **Mana Organs (World Standard Biology)**

All natural magic use relies on **Aurynea**—specialized biological organs that function like mana lungs.  
They **absorb ambient mana through breath**, filter impurities, and convert it into usable internal energy.  
Capacity is shaped by **genetics**, **training**, **environmental exposure**, **age**, and—most dramatically—**extreme stress**, which allows Strivers to forcibly grow or deform their Aurynea.

Aurynea have strict natural limits: overuse leads to **overheating**, **mana poisoning**, and eventual **structural collapse**, which can result in permanent loss of magic or death.  
Overload pushes casters into dangerous mutation cycles, with long-term users developing adaptive features and inexperienced casters suffering volatile bursts.

# **Universal Laws & Limitations**

Mana obeys strict natural laws inherent to Auranyx’s ecosystem:

- **True resurrection is impossible** — souls cannot be restored once dissolved.
    
- **Creation from nothing is prohibited** — mana only transforms existing matter or energy.
    
- **Time cannot be reversed**, and past physical events cannot be undone.
    
- **Souls cannot be rewritten or reshaped** — identity sits outside mana’s domain.
    
- **Infinite scaling is impossible** — output is capped by ambient density, Aurynea capacity, and mental discipline.
    
- **Space cannot be violated without structure** — teleportation or portals require existing pathways.
    

These laws prevent paradoxes, limit runaway power, and maintain balance within the world’s mana ecology.

# **Costs & Risks of Magic**

Magic places escalating strain on the body and environment:

- **Physical stress** from overusing Aurynea
    
- **Organ degeneration** from persistent overload
    
- **Heat buildup** and circulatory strain during intense casting
    
- **Temporary or permanent mutations** in long-term or high-exposure casters
    
- **Environmental backlash**, including mana blooms, swarms, or localized corruption
    

At extreme levels of misuse, casters risk **aberration**, **burnout**, **soul fracture**, or triggering **regional mana destabilization**.

# **Mana Behavior in Auranyx**

Mana behaves as a hybrid of **fluid dynamics**, **pressure systems**, and **magnetic ley-line attraction**.

It flows in **currents and tides**, forms **high-density regions** near vents and intersections, and reacts violently when pressure systems collide, creating **mana storms**.  
Disasters, celestial events, and tectonic shifts can dramatically shift mana levels, while certain environments accumulate mana into hazardous saturation zones or drain into deserts.

Auranyx possesses a true **mana weather system**, shaping ecosystems and civilizations alike.

# **Magic Categories (System-Level)**

Magic use branches into several fundamental types:

**Core/Common Types:**

- **Internal Manipulators** – shape mana inside the body; augmentation and precise bursts.
    
- **External Shapers** – sculpt ambient mana into barriers, constructs, or elemental forms.
    
- **Infusers** – channel mana into objects, tools, weapons, and mana-reactive technology.
    

**Niche/Rare Types:**

- **Resonants** – interact directly with ley lines and ambient flows.
    
- **Biocasters** – manipulate biological systems with mana.
    
- **Emitters** – release raw mana with minimal shaping.
    
- **Hybridists** – combine disciplines into unique personal styles.
    

All draw from the same source, but **rare individuals perceive or engage with mana differently**.

# **Interactions With Cosmology**

Mana is purely **natural**, produced by the planet rather than gods or divine intervention.  
Its fluctuations follow **long-term celestial cycles**, with moons, stars, and alignments influencing ambient density.  
Historic cataclysms have reshaped vents and ley lines, creating the world’s current magical geography.

Mana does not weaken or strengthen uniformly; instead, cycles and disasters dictate eras of abundance, drought, and chaos.

# **Historical Role of Magic**

Magic’s emergence reshaped history:

- **The First Mana Bloom** unleashed mana into the world, birthing monsters and mutating early humans.
    
- **Strivers** pioneered forced adaptation, forming the first mana traditions.
    
- **Monster Kings** pushed humanity into fortified enclaves.
    
- **The Age of Walls** saw magical barriers rise alongside reactor fortresses.
    
- **Reactor technology** gave non-casters access to artificial mana, igniting ideological divides.
    
- **The Great Schism** and **Forbidden Wars** scarred continents and rewrote magical ethics.
    
- **The Adventurer Age** empowered independent casters and Strivers.
    
- Now, in the **Spark of War**, shortages, surges, and assassinations set the stage for global conflict.
    

Magic has been the engine of evolution, warfare, ideology, and civilization itself.

# **In-Universe Terminology**

- **Mana (common term)** – everyday reference for ambient magical energy.
    
- **Aurox (scientific term)** – technical/academic designation for measurable mana.
    
- **Aurynea** – biological mana organs (Auryne singular).
    
- **Flux Lungs** – Striver slang for Aurynea.
    
- **Auronex / Auronexi** – technocratic/scientific term used in medical and reactor contexts.
    

These terms reflect cultural, biological, and technological perspectives on the same phenomenon.
